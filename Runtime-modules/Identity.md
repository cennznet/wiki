# Identity Module

The identity module provides a proof for an authentic identity. It requires the following information to determine token holder identity:

* Link to a Discord account
* Link to a Twitter account
* Proof of minimum stake

The identity module is useful for tasks that are associated with a real person, for example, voting. It prevents individuals from registering as multiple participants. This process will mean that the verified identity wonâ€™t be completely anonymous, but it doesn't require private information.

## Implementation

The identity module is based on the [Substrate Identity pallet](https://docs.substrate.io/rustdocs/latest/pallet_identity/index.html), but with a few CENNZnet specific changes:

* We've simplified the authorisation requirements
* We've added an additional CENNZnet interface to this module, which also gives us information about how many identities an account has registered
