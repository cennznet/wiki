# Governance Module

The governance module enables CENNZnet to have On-chain governance, which means the CENNZnet blockchain community can propose changes and vote on these chainges directly on-chain. This proces is entirely transparent and allows for changes to be instigated quickly.

Refer to our [AN INTRODUCTION TO CENNZNET GOVERNANCE](https://cennz.net/knowledge-hub/governance/an-introduction-to-cennznet-governance/) article for an introduction and roadmap.
