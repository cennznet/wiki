# Governance Module

The governance module enables CENNZnet to have On-chain governance, which means the CENNZnet blockchain community can propose changes and vote on these chainges directly on-chain. This proces is entirely transparent and allows for changes to be instigated quickly.

Refer to our [AN INTRODUCTION TO CENNZNET GOVERNANCE](https://cennz.net/knowledge-hub/governance/an-introduction-to-cennznet-governance/) article for an introduction and roadmap.

As a CENNZnet user, you can currently participate in governance in voting, or become an elected council member.

## Requirements

To participate in governance, you will need to verify your identity. This is to make sure votes and proposals come from real humans. 

You will also need a minimum amount of stake for both becoming a council member and voting. The initial minimum stake is set to 1000 CENNZ. This can be updated by Governance.

### Identity proofs

You will need to associate 2 or more of the following accounts with your CENNZnet account: 

* Email account
* A Discord account
* A Twitter account

You can make identity claims using the [Identity](Runtime-modules/Identity) module.

## Elected council

To become an elected council member, you will need to meet the requirement stated above, and complete an application form. See the article [THE ELECTED COUNCIL](https://cennz.net/knowledge-hub/governance/the-elected-council/) for more information.

## Voting

Currently one staked CENNZ gives one unit of voting weight. This means users who are staking more CENNZ have more say in the decisions.
