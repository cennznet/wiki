# The CENNZnet networks

Anyone can start a new CENNZnet network by starting a CENNZnet node. When you run a CENNZnet node, you can connect to an existing chain using a genesis file. The genesis file provides the initial state and configurations of the blockchain.

In the CENNZnet repository, you can find 3 genesis configurations. 
* **Azalea (the MainNet)**: is the production environment, where transactions and exchanges happen. The MainNet is used by all CENNZnet DApps. 

* **NikauðŸŒ´ (the TestNet)**: is the pre-production environment for testing bleeding edge features before they are deployed to Azalea. Nikau runs on nodes hosted on AWS. The CENNZnet team maintains Nikau and keeps it close to the MainNet.

* **Rata (the playground)**: is the testing environment that's not kept close to the production environment. You can also use this genesis file to start a small sandbox chain for testing locally. It can start a chain of nodes that runs in docker containers, all on your local machine. This allows you to test complex scenarios that aren't possible to test with a development chain, which consists of 1 node only. To connect to Rata, you will need to use the custom endpoint, [wss://kong2.centrality.me/public/rata/ws](wss://kong2.centrality.me/public/rata/ws).

## Connecting to a network
The easiest way to connect to one of the CENNZnet networks is to use the web portal, [CENNZnet.io](http://cennznet.io/). This web portal allows you to communicate with a node through WebSocket. You can select which network to connect to through the Network dropdown in Advanced->Settings->General:

For more information, see the [CENNZnet.io user guides](dev-tools/cennznet-io).

### Network websocket endpoints

When connecting to CENNZnet through the API, you can choose to connect to a public web socket, or to a local node.

**Azalea:** [wss://cennznet.unfrastructure.io/public/ws](wss://cennznet.unfrastructure.io/public/ws)

**NikauðŸŒ´:** [wss://nikau.centrality.me/public/ws](wss://nikau.centrality.me/public/ws)

**Rata:** [wss://kong2.centrality.me/public/rata/ws](wss://kong2.centrality.me/public/rata/ws)

```js
  // Initialise the provider to connect to the Azalea node
  const provider = 'wss://cennznet.unfrastructure.io/public/ws';

  // Create the API and wait until ready
  const api = await Api.create({provider});
```

## Joining the MainNet

As a DApp developer, it is beneficial to join the MainNet. Having nodes of your own allows your DApp to have better and faster access to the network. You can also monitise from the nodes by participating in staking as a validator.

To learn about how to set up a node, read our guides in the Network participating -> Node operating section, for example, [Running a Full Node](Network-participating/Node-operating/Running-a-Full-Node).
