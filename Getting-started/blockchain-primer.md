# Blockchain Primer

### What problem does blockchain solve?

From a computer science point of view, blockchain is an advanced solution to the [Byzantine Fault tolerance(BFT) problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault) that supports a large number of network participants. It provides a solution to reach consensus in a distributed system when technical failures and malicious actors are present. 

The [Proof of Stake consensus algorithm](https://cennz.net/knowledge-hub/blockchain-101/understanding-consensus-mechanisms/) used in CENNZnet is an advanced solution to the BFT(Byzantine Fault Tolerance) problem, which offers security and robustness with a low energy consumption.

## A closer look at how blockchain works

There are three key ingredients that makes blockchain unique:
* Cryptography 
* Data Structures 
* Incentives

## DApp development

If the idea of DApps(Decentralised Apps) is new to you, please first read our article [What is a DApp and why are they useful?](https://cennz.net/blog/featured-blog-post/what-is-a-dapp/).

The next step is to read the [CENNZnet technical overview](Getting-started/CENNZnet-technical-overview).
