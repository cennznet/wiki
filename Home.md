CENNZnet provides an easy-to-use API that lets to build fully  [decentralised applications (DApps)](https://cennz.net/blog/featured-blog-post/what-is-a-dapp/), or add a decentralised component to your existing app.

CENNZnet is a public blockchain network that powers DApps and the crypto currencies CENNZ and CPAY. It is built on top of the [Plug](https://github.com/plugblockchain/plug-blockchain/) framework.

CENNZnet features:
* ***Proof of Stake (PoS) [consensus mechanism](https://cennz.net/publications/understanding-consensus-mechanisms/)***: Facilitates a secure system while also rewarding our community and low energy requirements. 
* ***[Dual token economy](https://cennz.net/publications/tokens-on-cennznet-understanding-the-dual-token-economy/)***: CENNZnet has 2 primary tokens: CPAY and CENNZ. This ensures that gas fees remain stable while the CENNZ token value can fluctuate with crypto markets.
* ***Decentralised governance***: CENNZnet functions 100% on-chain using blockchain‚Äôs built in voting mechanisms.
* ***CENNZX***: CENNZnet implements a decentralised currency exchange (CENNZX) which provides spot price trades and integrated multi-currency fee payment.

Our mission is to provide a user-first experience for both DApp developers and their end users. We aim to make blockchain based services accessible for first time builders and end users so that everyone can enjoy the increased network transparency, data privacy and reliability that decentralisation offers.

## Quick Start

Start a full node named `my-node` and connect it to the CENNZnet MainNet:
```bash
# via docker
$ docker run cennznet/cennznet:1.5.1 \
    --chain=/cennznet/genesis/azalea.raw.json \
    --name=my-node \
    --telemetry-url 'ws://cennznet-telemetry.centrality.me:1024 0'

# via source
git clone https://github.com/cennznet/cennznet && git checkout release/1.4.0
cd cennznet && cargo build --release
./target/release/cennznet \
    --chain=./genesis/azalea.raw.json \
    --name=my-node \
    --telemetry-url 'ws://cennznet-telemetry.centrality.me:8000/submit 0'
```

Check `my-node` is running [here](http://cennznet-telemetry.centrality.me/#/CENNZnet-Azalea).
