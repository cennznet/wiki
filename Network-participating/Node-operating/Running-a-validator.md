# Validator Operations üõ†

This guide provides an overview of the essential steps to start a validator node.  
You should have familiarity with a unix shell and docker to get the most out of this guide.  

‚ö†Ô∏è The process of connecting a node with a CENNZnet account is described in the [staking guide](Network-participating/Staking/Validator-Staking-Guide)  
and must be performed before the node will participate in consensus and earn rewards  

## Let's go
In this example we provisioned a Digital Ocean droplet with the following spec & [docker installed](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-debian-10)  
```
450 GB disk
16GB Mem
2 vCPU
Ubuntu OS
```

### 1) Download the Latest Snapshot  
This is a snapshot of the CENNZnet blockchain maintained by Centrality.  
It will give the node a large head start on syncing the block data.  
**NOTE!** check https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cennznet-snapshots.centralityapp.com/azalea/1.2.2/validator/index.html
for the most recent snapshot file and substitute it in the command below  
```bash
SNAPSHOT_DATE=2021-03-16-1035
aria2c -x 8 "https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cennznet-snapshots.centralityapp.com/azalea/1.2.2/validator/NZDT-$SNAPSHOT_DATE-chains.tar.gz"

# extract the snapshot and move the 'chains' folder into './data/chains'
tar xvf NZDT-2021-03-16-1035-chains.tar.gz && \
mkdir data && \
mv chains/ data/
```

### 2) Generate P2P Network Identity üîë
This will create a 32 byte secret seed we can use for our node's p2p secret key.  
Setting this value will give the node a consistent p2p network identity improving its peer connections and discovery
on the network.  
Save this value somewhere secure so it can be reused by your node later.  
```
NODE_P2P_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

### 3) Start the Node

The command below will start a dockerized CENNZnet node.  
The `data` folder will be mounted into the container at `/data`, this contains the chain snapshot downloaded earlier.  

The important configurations are:  
`--node-key` the 32-byte seed network identity we generated earlier  
`--base-path` the path where the chain snapshot is mounted in the container i.e `/data`  
`--name` is any name you want your node to appear as when reported to the telemetry server  

```bash
# !!!Replace with your pre-generated key!!!
NODE_P2P_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
NODE_NAME="YOUR NODE NAME HERE"

docker run -d \
    --name=<container_name> \
    --restart=always \
    -p 9933:9933 \
    -v $(pwd)/data:/data \
    cennznet/cennznet:1.4.0 \
    --validator \
    --node-key=$NODE_P2P_KEY \
    --name=$NODE_NAME \
    --unsafe-rpc-external \
    --rpc-methods=Unsafe \
    --chain=/cennznet/genesis/azalea.raw.json \
    --base-path=/data \
    --telemetry-url 'ws://cennznet-telemetry.centrality.me:8000/submit 0'
```

### 4) Generate session keys
This command will ask your node to generate some keys which will be used for signing message to participate in consensus protocols
such as making blocks and voting on finality.  
```bash
curl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "author_rotateKeys", "params": []}' \
    localhost:9933
```
*after this step you maybe safely disable the `--rpc-methods=Unsafe` option*

Save this value for use in "claiming your session keys" step in the staking guide.  

### Done
That's it. Check your node's sync progress on the [telemetry site](http://cennznet-telemetry.centrality.me/) and follow the staking guide to connect your node to a CENNZnet account.
