# CENNZnet Faucet

## Using the faucet

To issue currencies to your account, you will need an account on the **TestNet**.

If you don't have an account, follow the [Intro Guide to CENNZnet.io](https://medium.com/centrality/using-cennznet-io-ac5a90f9a2cb) to learn how to create an account. **Note: please make sure you connect [CENNZnet.io](https://cennznet.io/) to the TestNet(Nikau)**.

If you already have an account on the TestNet, copy the public address from https://cennznet.io/#/accounts, and then input the address into the [faucet](https://cennznet-faucet-ui.centrality.me/).
