# CENNZX API

CENNZX is a decentralised spot exchange built into the CENNZnet protocol.
It is based on the Uniswap contract's automated market maker algorithm.
It allows investors to create asset liquidity pools and earn fees from trades, while it allows traders
to make simple and easy trades between assets.

To learn about how prices are determined, please refer to our [CENNZX guide]
(https://cennz.net/knowledge-hub/core-modules/the-cennzx-guide/). For more information on how Liquidity works, refer to [Liquidity on CENNZX](https://medium.com/centrality/liquidity-on-cennzx-517c877e91d9).

Because CENNZX is native to the CENNZnet protocol it is also integrated with network gas payment to provide transactors the ability to pay their fees in any liquid asset.
